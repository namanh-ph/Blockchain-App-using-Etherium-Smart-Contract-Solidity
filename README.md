# Blockchain Application Using Ethereum Smart Contracts And Solidity: Simple To-Do List

## Overview

This project hosts a simple decentralised to-do list application using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. It serves as a practical example of implementing smart contracts to manage and store data on the blockchain.

## Features

- Task Management on Blockchain: Users can add, complete, and revisit tasks stored securely on the blockchain.
- Ethereum Smart Contracts: Utilizes smart contracts for handling business logic and data storage.
- Transparency: Every interaction is recorded on Ethereum, ensuring transparency and security.
- Technologies used:
    - Ethereum and Solidity: Utilising Ethereum's blockchain with smart contracts written in Solidity to automate tasks management securely and immutably.
    - Truffle and Ganache: Compiling, deploying, and testing the contracts within a simulated environment.
    - Metamask and Web3.js: Connecting the web frontend to the Ethereum blockchain, enabling user interactions with the smart contracts through a familiar web interface.
